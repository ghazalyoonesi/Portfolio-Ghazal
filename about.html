        Hey there! I'm Ghazal Yoonesi, a passionate UX/UI design enthusiast. My
        journey started in language education, photography, and sales, and now
        I'm diving deep into design with Career Foundry. I love creating
        impactful and user-friendly solutions. I've had some fun experiences
        along the wayâ€”managing a bustling bakery in Paderborn, capturing the
        perfect shots for real estate listings at LemonOne, and teaching English
        to bright young minds in Tehran. I hold a BA in Script Writing and have
        tackled intensive English and German courses. Outside of work, I'm all
        about traveling, cycling, cooking up new recipes, playing board games,
        and getting lost in music and movies. If you want to chat or
        collaborate, drop me a line at yoonesi.ghazal@gmail.com!
